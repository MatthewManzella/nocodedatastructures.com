  <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" class="subtitle"><u
      style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Definition:</b></u>
    A data structure consisting of nodes (data - see blue dots above) connected by edges (links - see grey arrows
    above), representing relationships or connections between elements. There are 2 main characteristics of every graph:
  <div style="padding-left: 50px;">
    <ol>
      <li><u>Weight:</u> A graph can be categorized as either weighted or unweighted. In a weighted graph, each edge
        (link) is assigned a numerical value, such as distance or priority, representing a scalar unit between nodes of
        data. On the other hand, an unweighted graph has no assigned weights for its edges.</li>
      <br>
      <li><u>Direction:</u> A graph is either directed, meaning that every edge points towards a node (think an arrow),
        or undirected, meaning that edges don't have direction (think a straight line rather than an arrow).</li>
    </ol>

    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><u style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Real Life
          Example:</b></u>
      Think of graphs as street maps, where the locations are nodes and the streets are edges. The locations can only be
      accessed via the correct streets!

      <ol style="line-height: 2; font-size: 16px;">
        <li style="font-weight: normal; padding-bottom: 50px; padding-left: 50px;">Adding an edge and/or node. Here,
          node G is added to the graph and connected to node F via an added edge.</li>
        <img class="image" style="width: 700px;" src="../images/graph/graphadd.jpg">
        <li style="font-weight: normal; padding: 50px;">Removing an edge. Since node G has no edges connected to it
          after this removal, it is considered isolated. This means that it cannot be accessed until it is reconnected via
          adding a new edge.</li>
        <img class="image" style="width: 700px;" src="../images/graph/graphremoveedge.jpg">
        <li style="font-weight: normal; padding: 50px;">Removing a node. Notice that any edges connected to/pointing towards the removed
          node are removed as well.</li>

    <p style="font-weight: normal;"><u style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Fun Fact:</b></u> Given all of the
      different connections in most graphs, they can be very difficult to display. One of the most common solutions to this issue is implementing an adjacency matrix: </p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 15%; font-weight: normal;">
      <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><u>Adjacency Matrix:</u> A 2D <a href="array.html">array</a> representing connections between nodes
        within a graph. If two nodes are connected in a proper direction via an edge, a 1 is placed in the box where the
        two nodes meet in the array. If not, a 0 is placed in the box. The nodes listed on the left of the box represent
        the starting node and the nodes listed on top of the box represent the ending node. For example, the existence
        of an edge pointing from D to B results in the D/B box in the last row containing a 1, but not the B/D box in
        the second row. If the graph was undirected instead of directed, a 1 would be placed in both of those boxes.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b style="margin-left: 15%;">Note:</b> For weighted graphs, the weight from one node to another is placed in the
        box, not a 1.
